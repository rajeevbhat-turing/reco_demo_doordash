# Release Notes

### 🎨 UI Improvements

#### Food Descriptions Added to Menu Item Cards
Added menu item descriptions from the database to all relevant sections of the store page:
- Description is displayed above the item rating (Liked ratio) for better visual hierarchy
- Descriptions are limited to 2 lines with `line-clamp-2` to maintain consistent card heights
- Excluded from the Featured Items carousel to keep that section compact

**Files Modified:**
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app/store/[id]/page.tsx` | Added `item.description` rendering in Most Ordered section, Regular Menu Categories, and Search Results |
| `components/menu-item-dialog.tsx` | Added description display below item name in the menu item detail dialog |

#### Enhanced "Add to Cart" Button Visibility
Applied a stronger custom box-shadow to all "Add to cart" plus buttons for better visibility against any background color:
- **Before:** `shadow-md` (subtle, blends with white backgrounds)
- **After:** `shadow-[0_4px_14px_rgba(0,0,0,0.4)]` (distinctive, visible on any background)

**Files Modified:**
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app/store/[id]/page.tsx` | Updated shadow on plus buttons in Most Ordered gallery, Regular Menu Categories, and Search Results |
| `components/cart-sidebar.tsx` | Updated shadow on plus buttons for cart item thumbnails |
| `components/modals/deal-modal.tsx` | Updated shadow on plus buttons in the free items selection modal |

#### Pricing & Fees Modal Implementation
Made the "pricing & fees" text in the store page header clickable, opening a comprehensive ServiceFeesInfo modal with dynamic fee information:

**Modal Content Includes:**
- **Delivery Fee** — Dynamic based on restaurant's `isFreeDelivery` and `minDeliveryFee` settings
- **Service Fee** — Shows actual percentage (15%) and minimum ($4.99) from fee calculator, notes 10% increase for distances > 5 miles
- **Other Dashdoor Fees** — Express delivery fees ($2.99), regulatory fees
- **Menu Pricing** — Merchant pricing disclaimer

**Fee Structure (from `lib/utils/fee-calculator.ts`):**
- Service Fee: 15% of subtotal (minimum $4.99)
- Distance > 5 miles: +10% service fee
- Express Delivery: +$2.99 surcharge
- Distance-based delivery surcharges:
  - 0-2 miles: No surcharge
  - 2-5 miles: $0.50/mile
  - 5-10 miles: $0.75/mile
  - 10+ miles: $1.00/mile

**Files Modified:**
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app/store/[id]/page.tsx` | Added click handler to "pricing & fees" text, added state management for modal, passed restaurant data |
| `components/service-fees-info.tsx` | Updated to accept restaurant and category props, dynamically displays fee information from fee-calculator.ts |

#### Special Instructions Feature
Implemented a complete special instructions feature with a dedicated modal:

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
export interface SpecialInstructions {
  text: string;
  ifUnavailable: 'merchant_recommendation' | 'refund' | 'contact' | 'cancel';
}

export interface CartItem {
  // ... other fields
  specialInstructions?: SpecialInstructions;
}
```

**If Unavailable Options:**
- Go with merchant recommendation — Let the restaurant substitute
- Get a refund for the item — Refund if unavailable
- Contact me — Dasher contacts customer
- Cancel the entire order — Cancel if item unavailable

**UI/UX Details:**
- Modal uses React Portal to render outside parent DOM hierarchy
- Prevents event bubbling to avoid closing parent modals
- Menu item dialog becomes invisible while special instructions modal is open
- Instructions displayed with quotes in cart and order views

**Files Modified:**
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `store/cart-store.ts` | Added `SpecialInstructions` interface with `text` and `ifUnavailable` fields to `CartItem` |
| `components/modals/special-instructions-modal.tsx` | New file — Modal component for entering special instructions |
| `components/menu-item-dialog.tsx` | Added "Preferences" section with button to open special instructions modal |
| `components/cart-sidebar.tsx` | Displays special instructions text for cart items |
| `app/checkout/page.tsx` | Displays special instructions in order summary, includes in order data |
| `app/orders/[orderId]/page.tsx` | Displays special instructions in order details |

### 🎯 Task System Updates

#### Duplicate Task IDs Fixed
Identified tasks with duplicate IDs in the task dataset. Each task now has a unique identifier assigned, ensuring proper task tracking and evaluation. The duplicate entries were detected and reassigned sequential IDs to maintain data integrity.

#### Duplicate Task Statements Fixed
Replaced duplicate tasks with unique ones. The task dataset now contains distinct task entries, eliminating redundancy and ensuring each task represents a unique test scenario.

#### Modification Path Mismatch Fixed
Corrected the JSON path references in the grader configuration for item-addon-order tasks:
- **path_to_actual:** Changed from `$.items[0].modifications[0].options[0].id` to `$.items[0].modifications[0].options[0].optionId` to correctly reference the option identifier in the cart items structure
- **paths_to_expected:** Changed from `$[3].modifications[0].options[0].id` to `$[3].modification.options[0].id` to align with the actual response structure returned by the expected state functions

#### Dynamic Modification Name
The `modification_name` parameter in the grader configuration is now dynamically determined on task generation based on the actual modification type from the database. Size-related options (Small, Medium, Large) correctly use "size" as the modification name, while other options use "add-ons". The existing tasks in `dashdoor.csv` have been updated with this fix.

#### Task ID Column Added
Added `task_id` as a dedicated first column in the CSV output for better task identification and tracking.

### 🎯 Task System Updates

#### Bootstrap Data Configuration
All 200 tasks now include proper time simulation configuration:

- **Type A Tasks (60 tasks)**: Added base `bootstrap_data` with `date` and `timezone`
  ```json
  "simulator_config": {
    "bootstrap_data": {
      "date": "2025-12-19T12:00:00-08:00",
      "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Type B Tasks (140 tasks)**: Added `bootstrap_data` with `date`, `timezone`, and `user` + removed login instruction from `task_statement`
  ```json
  "simulator_config": {
    "bootstrap_data": {
      "date": "2025-12-19T12:00:00-08:00",
      "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
      "user": "email@example.com"
    }
  }
  ```

#### Verifier Index Fixes
Updated 31 task verifiers to use explicit array indexing in JSONPath expressions:

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tasks Updated | 39 |
| Verifier Changes | 31 |
| No Changes Required | 8 |

**Key Changes:**
- All `paths_to_expected` now use explicit array indexing (e.g., `$.address.id` → `$[0].address.id`)
- Index `$[n]` references the nth expected state function result from `extract_states_config.expected_state_functions`

#### Operator Changes
Two tasks received operator updates for proper validation:
- `cheapest-liked-combo`: `JSON_EQUALS` → `ARRAY_STRING_CONTAINS`
- `healthy-fixed-order`: `JSON_EQUALS` → `ARRAY_STRING_CONTAINS`

These changes split single assertions with multiple paths into separate assertions for independent validation.
